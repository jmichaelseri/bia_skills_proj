The Richmond Group was founded in 1999 around a kitchen table by serial entrepreneur, James, with £100 and a simple goal: to stop working in dead-end jobs and do something meaningful. Today our assets are over £1bn, we’ve served over half a million customers, won awards for our growth and product, and have been listed as a Sunday Times best company to work for since 2008.

We build, fund and oversee start-ups that disrupt markets where technology has so far failed to reduce the costs and improve the lives of ordinary people.

In this role you will have the ability to improve processes, products and the customer experience for international businesses within our investment porfolio. You'll be pro-actively looking for opportunities, inefficiencies and waste and be dedicated to ensuring we are maximising our opportunities at all times. In doing so, you will have huge exposure working directly with our founder, James, and other Directors across our business.

We think you'll need:
Honesty and humility - If you make a mistake, don’t cover it up. Admit it, learn from it and don't do it again. Be better for it
Ambition - a hunger to learn, self-reflect and do whatever it takes to become an invaluable member of the team
Persistence - Stick at a problem, task or project, despite any hurdles that are thrown at you along the way
Curiosity - Be comfortable venturing outside of your desk into the heart of the operation, connecting the dots between people, processes, systems and products
Flexibility - Be happy to switch gears and adapt quickly to changing tasks, projects and business needs
Energy, intelligence, numeracy skills, creativity and good written and oral communication
A track record of delivering tangible improvements to your work, as a result of acting with ownership
We'll ask you to:
Measure the performance of the Richmond Group’s investments, overseeing audits, targets and KPI's for all companies in our portfolio
Drive efficiency across the group and its investments through the monitoring and delivery of key information
Investigate and research systems, communications, customer and employee behaviour to protect our assets and find opportunities for growth
Undertake data-driven research to identify inefficiencies and waste, before working with key stakeholders to drive them through to improvement

Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses.

We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we’re united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won’t transform a business or save the world: it’s the people that count.

About You

• Guide the team in producing work of excellent quality that will ensure increases in revenue / traffic / other KPIs that are of Client concern
• We are particularly interested in people with agile scrum, UX or data/dashboarding experience!

To do that, it’s essential you bring the following:
• Scrum, UX or Data/Dashboarding experience
• A consistent track record in building digital products and utilising agile methodologies
• The ability to leverage your experiences in Product Management, Product Ownership, Business Analysis and UX roles to share your insight on how to build digital products

• Knowledge of digital technology applications including architecture and methods and the latest competitors on the market
Joining AND
From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us:
• We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
• There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
• Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.

Graduate Research Analyst (Portuguese/Spanish speaking),"The role

At Global Water Intelligence (GWI) we have made a business out of providing the information that helps
businesses solve the world’s water problems. We publish market-leading magazines, databases, and reports on the
international water industry, and now we would like to expand our coverage of the Latin American market.

We are looking for an inquisitive and enthusiastic graduate who is fluent in Portuguese and Spanish to join our
Oxford-based office. The position involves researching and writing accurate, interesting and exclusive
information on developments in Latin America’s water and wastewater treatment market, which will feature in our
newsletters, monthly magazine, project tracker, and GWI WaterData, our web-based premium market analysis
service.

As a Research Analyst at GWI you will get to grips with new subject areas, ask intelligent questions, and
investigate which data points we need in order to find answers. In return we can offer you the support of a
friendly and committed Oxford-based team, opportunities for travel (when travel is allowed again), and the
sense of satisfaction that comes with creating something yourself and being able to say, “I did that!”

Though we are currently working remotely during lockdown, we remain a close-knit group in which autonomy,
creativity and new ideas are welcome. As part of our team, you will be encouraged to take the opportunity to
grow and develop within the company.

Person requirements

If you are a recent graduate that is fluent in Portuguese and Spanish, and you think you might be good at two or three of the following skills, we would like to hear from you.
Interviewing people: If we are going to publish original content, we have to be good at drawing ideas and information out of people. That requires confident and intelligent staff who can network their way to talking to the right people and asking the right questions.
Writing and analysis: Fewer people have time to read these days. It means that if you are going to write, you have to write well. That means being able to organise your thoughts and express them concisely and with lucidity. Don’t be deterred if English is not your first language. We can edit for English.
An eye for detail: Our business depends on our ability to speak authoritatively, and we can’t do that if our work is riddled with errors.
Seeing the visual angle: People increasingly don’t consume information as text: they take it in visually. Feeding this kind of consumer is a challenge. It requires staff who can synthesise complex issues into simple graphics.
Collecting and managing data: We are the main source of data for the international water industry. With that responsibility comes a number of important skills: a nose for the information that will make a difference, and a doggedness in pursuit of it; a dexterity in squeezing spreadsheets until they tell a story; a deep commitment to accuracy; and, an instinctual feeling for the reality that data purports to represent.
Managing projects: Most of what we do is a team effort, but getting great people to work well together is a skill in itself. We need people who are organised empathetic communicators to bring it all together.
Seeing the bigger picture: We want to grow our business, and that involves having people at the front line who can see the opportunity to do things better.

Joining AND

From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us:
We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.
Still sound good? Great! Fill out the short application form below and we’ll be in touch.
